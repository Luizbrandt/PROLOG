# :green_book: PROLOG

#### Repo made for Artificial Inteligente - UNIFEI 2019

Prolog is a declarative language: instead of the program stipulating how to arrive at the solution step-by-step, as in procedural or object-oriented languages, it provides a description of the problem that is intended to be computed using a collection of facts and (logic) rules that indicate how the proposed problem should be solved. As we can see, Prolog is more about knowledge than about the algorithms themselves.
